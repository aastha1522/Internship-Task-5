Task 5 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival using Python and popular data visualization libraries.
The goal was to understand how factors like age, gender, class, and fare influenced survival outcomes.
The notebook walks through the complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process — from loading and cleaning data to analyzing and visualizing survival trends.
The analysis highlights hidden relationships between variables and offers a hands-on experience with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data storytelling.

# Key Steps

Data Cleaning – Handled missing values in the Age and Embarked columns, and created new derived features like is_adult and fare_bucket.

Exploration – Performed descriptive statistics, value counts, and grouped summaries for categorical and numerical variables.

Visualization – Used histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore relationships and detect trends.

Insights – Interpreted how demographic and economic factors impacted passenger survival.

# Insights

Women and children had a higher survival rate.

First-class passengers survived more than those in lower classes.

Higher fares correlated with a greater likelihood of survival.

Age, class, and gender combined played a crucial role in survival outcomes.

# Files Included
